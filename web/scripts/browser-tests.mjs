 * Runs the browser tests, and says what to do when it cannot.
 *
 * These run inside `npm run verify`, not beside it. A check that only runs in CI is one
 * nobody sees fail until after they have pushed — and the whole reason this layer exists is
 * that nine shipped things did not do what they said.
 *
 * **It refuses to skip.** A skipped test is an unmoored claim by another route: the suite
 * goes green, the summary says everything passed, and the thing was never checked. So a
 * missing browser is a failure with the one command that fixes it, not a shrug.
