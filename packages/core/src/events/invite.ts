/**
 * *"Here is my key. I would like to pair."*
 *
 * The fix for cold start. Until this existed the only way to pair was to stand next to
 * somebody, which serves a squad that already knows each other and nobody else — and the
 * operator this project is actually built around is the one who knows nobody.
 *
 * ## An accept is an invite in the other direction
 *
 * There is one message here, not three. A sends an invite to B; if B wants it, B sends an
 * invite back to A. Pairing is complete when each holds the other's key.
 *
 * That shape is not a shortcut, it is the reason declining is free:
 *
 * - **There is no decline message, and there cannot be one.** Ignoring an invite sends
 *   nothing, so a sender learns nothing — not that it was read, not that it was refused,
 *   not that the key is live. Somebody who owes a refusal is somebody who accepts to avoid
 *   an awkward one, and this is the same rule as `unpair` sending nothing
 * - There is no pending state on the sender's device to manage, expire or nag about, and
 *   nothing anywhere to show a *"waiting on Raven"* line
 *
 * ## Which key an invite is addressed to
 *
 * The first one goes to a **contact key** read off a public card. The reply goes to the
 * sender's **operational key**, which the first invite carried inside its ciphertext. So an
 * operator's working key reaches only people they chose to write to, and a card never
 * exposes it — see `events/public.ts` for why that separation is load-bearing.
 *
 * ## The wrapper
 *
 * Same shape as peer presence: a throwaway key signs the outer event, the sealed content is
 * a complete event signed by the sender's real key. A relay storing invites therefore
 * learns who has an inbox and roughly how busy it is, and nothing about who is writing to
 * whom. The inner signature is what proves the key being offered actually belongs to the
 * person offering it — a payload that merely states a pubkey can state anybody's.
 *
 * Normative source: docs/spec/signals.spec.md
