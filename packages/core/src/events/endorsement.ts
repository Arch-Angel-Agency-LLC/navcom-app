/**
 * Vouching for somebody, without creating a record of them.
 *
 * An endorsement is an attestation whose subject happens to be a person: a claim, its author,
 * and a scope tag — **signed, and held by the recipient rather than indexed anywhere.**
 *
 * ## The credential names nobody
 *
 * This is the part that decides everything else, and it is not an optimisation. A credential
 * reads *"I vouch for the holder of this"* — it carries a scope and a date and **no subject
 * at all**, and it binds to whatever persona claims it.
 *
 * So an endorser can never create a record naming a person who has not agreed to exist in
 * this system. The consent problem is resolved at its root rather than managed, and you can
 * vouch for somebody who has never opened the app.
 *
 * What follows from it, rather than needing its own argument:
 *
 * - **No central social graph.** Nobody, including us, can query who knows whom. There is
 *   nothing to breach, sell, subpoena or leak
 * - **Verification is local and offline.** You present; my device checks signatures. No
 *   network, no lookup, no server
 * - **Provenance by name, never a count.** You trust somebody because you recognise who
 *   vouched for them. A tally can be manufactured; a recognised author cannot
 *
 * ## The cost, stated
 *
 * A credential that names nobody is a **bearer token**: whoever holds the bytes can claim
 * it. Somebody who intercepts an unclaimed one before its intended recipient becomes its
 * holder, and the endorser cannot see that it happened — they cannot see whether it was
 * claimed at all.
 *
 * That is the price of not naming people, and this design pays it deliberately. It is
 * survivable because a credential is handed over the way everything else here is: in person,
 * or through whatever the two of them already use.
 *
 * ## Age rather than expiry
 *
 * A credential carries the date it was written and nothing expires on a timer. Somebody
 * endorsed `medic` five years ago is a fact about five years ago, and this system already
 * has one way of handling that: **show the age and let the reader weigh it**, exactly as the
 * directory does. Inventing an expiry would be a second rule for the same problem.
 *
 * Withdrawal is explicit — an endorser publishes a revocation, checked when online. An
 * endorser retracting their own claim is not an appeal, and creates no adjudication between
 * anybody [`declined.md`].
 *
 * Normative source: docs/product/identity.md

/**
 * What an endorsement can say. **Never free text.**
 *
 * An endorser explaining *why* somebody is credible is how an operator's history leaks —
 * and the person with the most valuable knowledge is usually the one with the most to lose
