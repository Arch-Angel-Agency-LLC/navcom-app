 *
 * ## A date in the future is not fresh
 *
 * It used to be the freshest thing possible: a negative age clears every staleness
 * threshold, so `2030-01-01` rendered as `high` confidence and `99999-01-01` did too. That
 * is wrong in three different ways at once.
 *
 * - A typo. `2036` for `2026` makes a stale record look checked this morning
 * - A wrong clock. A phone set years ahead writes corrections nobody can outrank
 * - **A cheap attack on the directory merge.** Corrections are weighed by confidence and
 *   ties break on the date, so a correction dated 2099 wins against every honest one,
 *   forever, from anybody
 *
 * So beyond a day's tolerance the future reads as **unverifiable** rather than as recent.
 * One day rather than zero because timezones are real: a record verified this evening in
 * Auckland is tomorrow in UTC, and calling that a forgery would break honest data to catch
 * a case that a day's grace already covers.
 *
 * The same reasoning `watch-state.ts` already applies to an event stamped in the device's
 * future, which reads Dark rather than current.
