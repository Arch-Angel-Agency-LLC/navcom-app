/**
 * Encrypting to the Watchtower.

 * **Signals are encrypted to the Watchtower key, not to the individual holding watch.**

 *
 * The cost is explicit rather than implied: the box can read every signal. It already holds
 * the board, runs the agent and executes escalation.
 *
 * NIP-44 comes from nostr-tools — the reference implementation. This project does not ship
 * its own cryptography on a boundary protecting people at risk.
