# Build Order

What comes after what, and what must be true first. **Sequence, not permission** — the
scope rule in [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md) still holds, and nothing below is licence to
start something early.

This page exists so the trajectory survives between sessions instead of being re-derived
or quietly redirected.

## The gate model

Two tracks run in parallel, and only one of them is gated.

## Now

**On the box.** Session 1 is **done — all seven definition-of-done checks pass** (confirmed
2026-08-18). The gate below is open.

**Here.** The `navcom.app` static site. It has **no dependency on the loop** — no protocol,
no keys, no relay, no daemon — which is what makes it the correct parallel work rather
than a distraction from the build order.

| | Step | Status |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Scaffold — SvelteKit, static adapter, in `web/` | **done** |
| A2 | Directory core — staleness, confidence, parsing. Pure logic, 30 tests | **done** |
| A3 | Directory UI — all six display rules. Rule 4 is a stated gap | **done** |
| A4 | Docs surface — renders the repo markdown at build time | **done** |
| A5 | Status page — says *"escalation not built, no drills run"* until it isn't | **done** |
| A6 | Deploy — Vercel, static, at `navcom.app` | **done** |

`npm run verify` in `web/` runs type-check, data check, build, tests and budget together.
`npm run check:data` alone answers "is my CSV edit valid" in about a second.

**Measured:** 37 pages, worst page 8.0 kB gzipped, **zero JavaScript delivered** — every
page works with scripting disabled. Budget is enforced by `web/scripts/budget.mjs`, which
measures what a browser downloads for a page rather than what sits in `build/`; those
differ sharply here, because the client build still emits chunks no page ever loads.

**Verified, not assumed.** `npm run verify` runs type-check, build, 45 tests and the
budget. The display rules have regression tests asserted against the **built HTML**, not
only against the logic — a component edited to "simplify" the stale case would otherwise
pass every unit test while shipping the failure the schema exists to prevent. Contrast is
measured against WCAG AA in both themes rather than claimed. The pages have been rendered
and looked at, at desktop and at a true 390px viewport.

**Known and deliberate:** display rule 4 (one-tap flagging) is not met on a static site and
the page says so. The status page's component list is hand-maintained and will drift from
this file. The markdown pipeline is unsanitised, which is safe only because the input is
this repository.

**Live at [navcom.app](https://navcom.app).** Vercel, static output, no serverless
functions — the deploy runs `npm run verify`, so a build that breaks a display rule or the
bundle budget cannot ship. Web Analytics and Speed Insights stay off: both inject a script,
which would break the zero-JavaScript property and H8.

**Data is partitioned by region** — `data/regions/<slug>/` with a manifest carrying country,
IANA timezone, languages and whether anyone has checked it. Done while there was one region,
because it is cheap now and painful once several people are editing one file.

**What is left before this is a real directory:** data. Everything else works.

## Unblocked — session 1 passed

**Extract the shared core** — **done.** `packages/core` holds the attestation model, keys,
NIP-44 sealing, the four event kinds, the board and the directory library. 88 tests. `web/`
is its first consumer via `file:../packages/core`; the node is the second.

Two rules are now enforced in code rather than only written down: a watch state demotes
`automated-oncall` to `automated` when nobody is pageable or no drill has passed, and hard
expiry can never drop a `distress` entry.

**Field Terminal — Status screen: done.** Lives at `/terminal/`, same domain and one build,
but in its own route group so it inherits none of the site's chrome, stylesheet or
assumptions. It renders Dark before anything is configured, which is the correct answer
rather than a placeholder, and states the consequence rather than the label.

**Authorship is explicit in the wire format.** `oncall` is a list of authored declarations
rather than a count the node picks; `last_drill` carries an author and an acknowledgements
array; a `20912` names its responder as an author; accountability entries are hash-chained.
None of it requires counter-signing to ship, and all of it makes counter-signing additive
rather than a payload break across three clients and a node.

**Two budgets, and the split is enforced.** The public site delivers **zero** JavaScript
against a budget of zero — it fails on the first byte, because a document must stay readable
with scripting off. The terminal is an application and gets 140 kB; it currently uses 36.4.

Remaining screens once the protocol has stopped moving. UI built against an unproven
payload gets rewritten when the payload changes, which is the whole reason for the gate.

## Gated on opening past people you personally vetted

**Counter-signed capability.** On-call operators declare their own reachability, drills
carry acknowledgement signatures from whoever woke up, and log entries are counter-signed by
their subjects. The slots exist and are empty; this fills them.

The gate is honest rather than arbitrary. While the circle is people you trust directly, the
node's own account of itself is adequate. The moment the pubkey goes wider, a Watchtower
that vouches for itself is exactly the claim a compromised one has most reason to make.

**Redundant escalation executors.** More than one box able to run the ladder, made
idempotent by distress event id. Duplicate pages are a nuisance; a single executor dying
mid-`Distress` is not. Paging is already specified as parallel rather than serial for the
same reason — in an emergency you want everyone.

This is ranked above decentralising the board on purpose: **a watch going Dark is
survivable and specified. An escalation that never fires is not.**

## Gated on the Field Terminal

**Console.** Served from the box over LAN or localhost — see [`delivery.md`](delivery.md)
for why it cannot be served from navcom.app.

## Gated, and treated differently

**The escalation ladder.** It does not get the move-fast treatment the loop gets. The seven
failure-mode tests in [`spec/escalation.spec.md`](spec/escalation.spec.md) are written
*before* it ships, not after.

**Mecha Jono holding the board** is session 2, and it is one function call. Everything in
[`watch/agents.md`](watch/agents.md) is about what happens *around* that call.

**Native Android/iOS** is Mk1, for the two capabilities a PWA cannot provide. Decided,
deferred.

## Not started, and not to be started

Endorsements, presets, funding, propagation mechanics, recovery, allied interop, RelayNode,
Mission Package ingestion.

**A multi-holder Watchtower** — signals sealed to a set of keys rather than one, so several
nodes hold the same board — is a real option rather than an impossibility, and the earlier
claim that "the watch cannot be decentralised" was wrong. What cannot be distributed is
*who is accountable*: one name, because diffused responsibility means nobody acts. The board,
query answering and escalation can all be held by more than one party.

It is deferred on a cost rather than a principle. Sealing to M keys means M parties hold the
operational picture, and the threat model here is doxxing — so decentralising the board
widens exposure while narrowing dependence. That trade needs a reason, and one box run by
one person for a handful of people they trust is not yet it.

Each is designed. None is scope. A spec written before the loop is proven is a guess in a
more confident format — [`spec/README.md`](spec/README.md) says so about itself.

## Open decisions

## The seeding rule

Recorded here because it is the easiest way to do real harm quickly, and it governs A2–A3.

**Seed structural facts. Never seed intake rules.**

Name, address, type, phone and published hours are public and checkable, and
[`product/propagation.md`](product/propagation.md) explicitly endorses seeding them from
public sources at `method: website`, low confidence, visually distinct [C21].

`sobriety`, `pets`, `id_required`, `referral_required`, `sex_offender_ok`, `curfew` and
`belongings` are the fields the directory exists for, and they are absent from public
listings precisely because nobody maintains them. **They start `unknown` and stay `unknown`
until a human with local knowledge verifies them.** A plausible guess in those fields is
the Medic's kill trigger and the fastest way to end the project.
